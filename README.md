# Medical Inventory Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize medical inventory management to reduce bounce rates and maximize revenue in healthcare facilities. Leveraging data-driven insights and visualization techniques, we enhance patient satisfaction and improve operational efficiency.

## Business Problem
Healthcare facilities are experiencing an increase in bounce rates, which translates to patient dissatisfaction and potential revenue loss.

## Business Objective

### Primary Objective
- Reduce bounce rates by 30%, minimizing patient frustration and ensuring timely access to necessary medical resources.

### Secondary Objective
- Optimize inventory costs without compromising patient care. This includes reducing stockouts, minimizing waste from expired medications, and streamlining procurement processes.

## Success Criteria

### Business Success Criteria
- Reduce bounce rates by 30%.

### Economic Success Criteria
- Increase revenue by 20 lacs INR by reducing bounce rate-related losses.

## Insights

### Dataset
- **medical_dataset** (14,218 records)
- **Key Columns**: Typeofsales, Patient_ID, Specialisation, Dept, Dateofbill, Quantity, ReturnQuantity, Final_Cost, Final_Sales, RtnMRP, Formulation, DrugName, SubCat, SubCat1

### Data Analysis

#### Before Data Cleaning
- Identified missing values needing imputation or removal.

#### After Data Cleaning
- Improved data quality and accuracy.

## Visualization Techniques

- **Line Graph Decomposition**: Decomposes trends in bounce rates for a deeper understanding of underlying factors.
- **Tree Plot**: Visualizes the hierarchical structure of factors influencing bounce rates, highlighting the impact of different departments, specializations, or types of sales.
- **100% Stacked Plot**: Depicts the composition of bounce rates across various categories, enabling rapid identification of high-impact areas.
- **Donut Chart**: Provides a clear overview of the distribution of bounce rates by category.
- **Card Slicer**: Offers an interactive way to explore and filter data based on specific criteria, facilitating deeper investigation of trends.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the significant role data-driven decision-making plays in optimizing medical inventory management. By harnessing the power of data and visualization, we can significantly improve patient satisfaction, operational efficiency, and ultimately, healthcare facility revenue.
